How the internet works?
- A network is something that connects two devices either through a wired or wireless network.
- This become too complicated when there are many devices so we have the Network switch.
- A network switch can connect to another network switch.
- Multiple network switches is called the Internet.
- If you want the internet to connect to video streaming sites it needs to connect to something called the server that provides them.
- These are then sent to devices called client as an output.
- This is called the client server model
- A server is a computer that runs applications and services ranging from websites to messaging.
- A server is stored in the data centre.
- A web server - website storage, data storage, and handle web request.
- A web server responds to web requests from the client.

Webpages vs websites
-A website is a collection of webpages.
-A webpage is just a text document and can be opened with any text editor.
- Page rengering - a complete web page is needed to fullfil the request of the client from the web server.

How does a web browser work?
- URL - uniform resource locator
- https - protocol
- then comes domain name
- and file path
- A web browser is a software application that you use to browse the world wide web.
- When you enter the URL and press enter, the web browser connects to another computer called the web server.
- The web server responds by sending a webpage back to the server.
